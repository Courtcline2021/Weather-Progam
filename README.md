# Weather Program 
This is a weather application that prompts the user to select a city of their choice and it will display the current weather in the city selected. 
I am running into issues where the url/ api I am getting arent working properly. 
So I am doing research to see what can be don to fix the issues. 
Also running into a timing/ memory issue where the api/ url is so huge to read and cause a glith in the code. 
I have two seperated code files for different approaches I want to get both of them to work. 
Still need to add error handling properties to ensure the programs fails gracefully.
